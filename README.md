# Data-wrangling-Data-Preprocessing-using-python
In this project, I performed data wrangling on WeRateDogs Twitter data. It involved the process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data in order to prepare it for analysis &amp; visualization.

Analysis & Visualisation: After finishing the data wrangling process, I saved the cleaned data in the "twitter_archive_master.csv" file and performed further analysis and visualizations. 
My first insight was made by using “value_counts()” method on the “source” column, which indicated that most tweets were done on iPhone as you can see from the above bar plot.
Second insight was made by using “value_counts()” method on “dog_stages” column which indicated that the top dog stage are pupper & doggo, while puppo & floofer are the least dog stage type dogs tweeted.
Third insight was made by using “value_counts()” method on “name” column which indicated that the most common dog names were 'Charlie', 'Lucy', 'Cooper', 'Oliver'.
Before creating visualization, matplotlib.pyplot was imported. The only visualization created was on the top dog stages using pie plot which is shown below.
